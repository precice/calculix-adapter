The adapter was initially developed for conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations via preCICE by Lucia Cheung in the scope of her master’s thesis [[1]](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). For running the adapter for CHT simulations refer to this thesis. The adapter was extended to fluid-structure interaction by Alexander Rusch [[2]](https://www.gacm2017.uni-stuttgart.de/registration/Upload/ExtendedAbstracts/ExtendedAbstract_0138.pdf).

This adapter was developed for **CalculiX version 2.16.** Other versions may be compatible, yet they have not been tested. Please let us know if you want to use a different version.

Adapters for other versions of CalculiX and preCICE are available in various branches. Branches compatible with **preCICE v2.x:**
 - master
 - v2.15_preCICE2.x
 
 All other branches are compatible with **preCICE v1.x**.
