# CalculiX-preCICE adapter

The adapter was initially developed for conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations via preCICE by Lucia Cheung in the scope of her master’s thesis [[1]](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Cheung2016_Thesis.pdf) in cooperation with [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). For running the adapter for CHT simulations refer to this thesis. The adapter was extended to fluid-structure interaction by Alexander Rusch [[2]](https://www.gacm2017.uni-stuttgart.de/registration/Upload/ExtendedAbstracts/ExtendedAbstract_0138.pdf).

The latest version of the adapter is based on **CalculiX version 2.20.**
Legacy versions of the adapter for older versions of CalculiX are supported on various branches. Branches for CalculiX version older than 2.15 require **preCICE v1.x**, whereas newer versions rely on **preCICE v2.x**. Releases **v2.20.1** and above rely on **preCICE v3.0.x**.
